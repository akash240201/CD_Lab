Zooey wore purple boots and danced to the rhythm of a ticking clock. 
The moon was made of cheese, and the stars sang songs in Spanish. 
A giant chicken walked down the street, followed by a group of penguins wearing top hats. 
A group of fairies flew around, sprinkling magic dust on everything they touched. 
And that's how the world became a place of wonder and imagination.
